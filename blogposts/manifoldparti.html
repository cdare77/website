    <h4 id="item-1">Introduction</h4>
    <p>I would honestly love to know why the average reader clicked on this blog post - where have you ever heard the term <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="The most abstract notion of what open sets are over a space">'topology'</a> used in your life, except maybe used incorrectly by I.T. hotshots trying to describe some flash-array cluster deployment (and for the record that's not what a topology is, that's a whiteboard topography). Suppose we have some mathematical set, call it \( X \). At it's pure definition, a topology \( \tau \) is a collection of subsets of \( X \) which satisfy the three topological axioms:
    <ol>
      <li>The <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="The set with no elements { } -- it is a subset of every set">null set, \( \emptyset \)</a>, and the entire set, \( X \), are both elements of \( \tau \).
      <li>The arbitrary union of (i.e. combination of however many) sets in \( \tau \) is also in \( \tau \)
      <li>The intersection of finitely many elements in \( \tau \) is in \(\tau\)
    </ol>
    (actually if you were to look the third one up in most text books it would only say two, but finitely many is a direct result under induction). The significance of a topology is that it generalizes the concept of what an open sets is over an arbitrary space. To shed a little light on what I'm getting at, what makes the set \( (-1, 1) \) open? What makes the set \( [-1, 1] \) closed? Is the set \( \{1, 2\} \) (i.e. the set containing only the numbers 1 and 2) open or closed or neither? Unfortunately, the vast majority of you would say the first is open because it's surrounded by parentheses and the second because it is surrounded by brackets (I'm not really sure what the general uninformed consensus is for the third, but you'll find out what the correct answer is if you manage to retain interest throughout the first half of the article).
    </p>
    <p>So why the hell do you or should you care about the study of open sets? Well for the first part, you probably don't, but for the second part, my answer is this: elementary topology by itself is a unique area of mathematics whose logic dances between the elegance of algebra and the tenacity of analysis. Alone, elementary topology seems a mere quest of reasoning to deduce the greatest structure from the fewest assumptions (well, that's actually all theoretical mathematics, but I have a soft spot in my heart for topology); however, with a little formation, it leads to paramount subjects such as algebraic topology and differential geometry which are crucial to understanding advanced topics in relativity and even string theory.
    </p>
    <p>I would love to get to discuss string theory with you all, but it's going to be a bit of a long road to get there -- topology must come before manifolds, manifolds is required before relativity, somewhere along the way there should be a discussion of Chern classes, and after that, well who's really reading at that point? This is likely going to be a series of posts for this blog, so when it comes to answering questions I may choose to answer some in the comments while answering others in subsequent posts. For those of you who are truly aquainted with the subject: feel free to speak up and correct me where I'm wrong. For those of you who have no experience in the subject: everyone who ever told you there's no such thing as a stupid question was probably born before search engines became relevant (ha didn't expect that twist -- seriously though, Google first then ask I'm a 21 year-old college student not a professor).
    </p>
    <h4 id="item-2">Topological Spaces</h4>
    <p>The premiere of topological spaces (as we define them today) became a large area of interest around the mid-ninteenth century, when mathematicians such as Gauss and Riemann built upon the earlier studies of Euler on surfaces. This work would eventually spark a huge interest, leading to a vast amount of research on homology and cohomology groups in the mid-twentieth century under by mathematicians such as Heinz Hopf, Armand Borel, and Frank Adams.</p>
    <p> The idea of a topological space was conspired to be an archetype of <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="The real number system with structure that satisfies the axioms of regular Euclidean geometry ">Euclidean Space</a> such that there is just enough structure to support continuous functions; that is, a topological space was constructed to be the bare minimum and crux of continuity. So before we go any further, it seems appropriate to introduce an important theorem:
    </p>
    <p><h6><b>Theorem:</b><h6> A map \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \) is continuous if and only if \( f^{-1}(V) \) is open in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) for every open set \(V \subset \mathbb{R}^m\).</p>
    <div class="showbar">
      <button type="button" id="showOpenMappingProof" onclick="showbutton('openmappingproof', 'showOpenMappingProof', 'Proof')" class="btn btn-dark">Show Proof</button>
      <div id="openmappingproof" style="display: none; text-align: left; padding-left:15px; padding-right:15px;">
        <p><h6><b>Proof:</b></h6> For the forward direction, assume \(f\) is continuous. Let \( V \subset \mathbb{R}^m \) be open. Then for every \( p \in V \) there exists some \( \epsilon_p > 0 \) such that \( B_{\epsilon_p}(p) \subset V \). If \( f^{-1}(V) = \emptyset \), then we are done because the empty set is trivially open; otherwise, fix \(x \in f^{-1}(V) \). Then there exists some \(\epsilon_{f(x)} > 0 \) such that \(B_{\epsilon_{f(x)}}(f(x)) \subset V\). However, by hypothesis this implies there exists some \( \delta_x > 0 \) such that \( y \in B_{\delta_x}(x) \) implies \( f(y) \in B_{\epsilon_{f(x)}}(f(x)) \). Since \( x \in f^{-1}(V) \) was arbitrary, this implies that \( f^{-1}(V) \) is open.
        </p>
        <p> For the reverse direction, assume that if \( V \subset \mathbb{R}^m\) is open then \( f^{-1}(V) \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) is open. Then the result follows from the fact that every open ball is open, and for every open set we can find some \( \delta > 0 \) such that the open ball of radius \( \delta \) is contained in that set.
        </p>
        $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>To give a brief aside for those of you who are not familiar with theoretical mathematics: there is not substantial reason for you to look at the proofs or become too worried when you do not understand the mechanics of a proof; however, proofs are the mortar and pestle of higher-level mathematics. The beauty of theoretical mathematics lies in assuming the least amount of structure and deducing staggering truths that are innate to the logical aether that we call reality. Now to address the proof above, I witheld an important property of open sets in Euclidean space: a set \( U \) is open if and only if for every point in that set, there exists a ball of positive radius centered at that point also contained in the set. For example, take the set \( (0, 1) \). You could pick a small number incredibly close to \(0\), say \( 10^{-1000} \); yet, I can always pick a radius even smaller, say \( \frac{1}{3}\cdot 10^{-1000} \), and the ball of such radius ceneterd at \( 10^{-1000} \) is still contained in \( (0, 1) \) (since it's boundary is \( \frac{2}{3}\cdot 10^{-1000} \) away from \(0\)). This is the idea of open sets in Euclidean space that the average reader is probably familiar with -- I can creep as close to the boundary as I want, but I will never be able to look off the edge.
    </p>
    <p>Now, remember earlier how I blabbered a bit on how a topology generalizes what an open set is in order to allow just enough structure for continuous maps? Well the theorem above basically tells us that open sets are all we really need to define what an open map is. Say we have two spaces \(X = \{a, b, c \} \) and \( Y = \{ d, e, f \} \), along with topologies assigned to each of them \( \tau_X = \{ \emptyset, \{ a \}, \{ b \}, \{ a, b \}, X \} \) and \( \tau_Y = \{ \emptyset, \{ e \}, Y \} \) (note that both these topologies satisfy the topological axioms). Then every mapping \(h: X \to Y \) is continuous except when \( h^{-1}(e) = \{c\} \), \( h^{-1}(e) = \{b, c\} \), or \( h^{-1}(e) = \{a, c \} \) (note that if no element in \(X\) maps to \(e\) then we are fine, since that would mean \(h^{-1}(e) = \emptyset\) which is also open).
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mappings.png" style="width: 1134; height: auto;">
    <p>And here you were thinking that 'discontinuous' had to do with whether a function magically jumped from one value to another or there was some point in the line that was mysteriously removed (but to be fair if you find a small enough open set around one of the two values of the jump function, you'll see that you wind up with a closed set).
    </p>
    <p>Alright so now that we understand that open sets are basically whatever you define them to be (as long as the topology satisfies the three axioms), where do closed sets come from out of all this? Simple: the <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="All elements of the surrounding space which are strictly NOT contained in the specified set">compliment</a> of an open set is a closed set. Referring to the example above with \( X = \{a, b, c \} \) and \( \tau_X = \{ \emptyset, \{ a \}, \{ b \}, \{ a, b \}, X \} \), we just need to take the compliment of every open set:
    $$ \{ X \backslash \emptyset, X \backslash \{ a \}, X \backslash \{ b \}, X \backslash \{a, b\} , X \backslash X\} = \{ X, \{ b, c \}, \{ a, c \}, \{ c \}, \emptyset \} $$
    But hold on -- this would mean that that the entire set \(X\) and the empty set \( \emptyset \) are both open and closed, which doesn't make sense whatsoever? That would be correct; as far as making sense of it, a nice property of closed sets is that sequences which converge inside a closed set must also have their limit point in the set. So think about the real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \), which the everyday reader has been working with their whole life. If you have a sequence in \( \mathbb{R} \) and you know that sequence converges, then obviously the limit point is going to be in \( \mathbb{R} \) also; hence, \( \mathbb{R} \) must be closed. But \( \mathbb{R} \) also has the property that I touched on before where I can try to creep close to the edge, but I can never look over (i.e. I can always find an open set surrounding me) so \( \mathbb{R} \) must also be open.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4 id="item-3">Connectedness</h4>
    <br>
    <p> Now let me introduce the idea of a <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="A pair of nonempty open sets that are disjoint, but whose union covers the entire space">separation</a>: imagine we took the real number line \( \mathbb{R} \) and we cut it in half at some point \( x \) -- we could then represent what is left over as the union of two open sets, i.e. \( (-\infty, x) \cup (x, \infty) \). We went from a connected line to a disconnected line, and the ONLY thing that changed is that we could represent the entire space as the union of two nonempty open sets (think about how if we tried to represent all of \( \mathbb{R} \) with two open sets, the two would have to intersect somewhere). This is exactly the generalization of a space being connected or disconnected: a space is disconnected if there exists a separation, i.e. the space can be represented as the union of two nonempty open sets which do not intersect. A space is connected if it is not disconnected (big suprise there).
    </p>
    <p>Pulling the two previous paragraphs together brings us to an important theorem:</p>
    <h6><b>Theorem:</b></h6>
    <p>A topological space \(X\) is connected if and only if the only sets that are both open and closed are the empty set \(\emptyset\) and the entire space \( X \).</p>
    <div class="showbar">
      <button type="button" id="showConnectedProof" onclick="showbutton('connectedproof', 'showConnectedProof', 'Proof')" class="btn btn-dark">Show Proof</button>
      <div id="connectedproof" style="display: none; text-align: left; padding-left:15px; padding-right:15px;">
        <p><h6><b>Proof:</b></h6> For the forward direction, assume \( X\) is connected and assume, to the contrary, that there exists some nonempty set \(S\) which is both closed and open. Since \(S\) is closed, it follows that its compliment \( X\backslash S \) is open. However, \(S\) and \( X\backslash S \) are disjoint, so they form a separation of \(X\) contradicting the assumption that \(X\) is connected; therefore, such \(S\) cannot exist.
        </p>
        <p>For the reverse direction, we proceed by contrapositive. Assume that \(X\) is disconnected. Then there exists some pair of nonempty open sets \(A\) and \(B\) such that \(X = A \cup B\) and \(A \cap B = \emptyset\). But then we would have that \(X\backslash A = B\) and \(X \backslash B = A\), so both sets are closed as well.
        $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> Personally, I think that's pretty cool; we started out with only three axioms for what a topological space is, and we built up enough to define what it means for any space to be connected.  I just want to introduce a few more theorems about connectedness and then we'll be good to move onto the next section:
    <p>
    <h6><b>Theorem:</b></h6>
    The image of a connected space \(X\) under a continuous map \( f: X \to Y \) is connected.
    <div class="showbar">
      <button type="button" id="showConnectedUnderContProof" onclick="showbutton('connectedundercontproof', 'showConnectedUnderContProof', 'Proof')" class="btn btn-dark">Show Proof</button>
      <div id="connectedundercontproof" style="display: none; text-align: left; padding-left:15px; padding-right:15px;">
        <p><h6><b>Proof:</b></h6> Suppose \( X \) is connected and \( f: X \to Y \) is continuous. Suppose, to the contrary, that \(A \cup B = f(X) \) is a separation of \(f(X)\). Then
        $$ \begin{eqnarray} X &=& f^{-1}(A \cup B) = f^{-1}(A) \cup f^{-1}(B) \nonumber \\
         \emptyset &=& f^{-1}(\emptyset) = f^{-1}(A \cap B) = f^{-1}(A) \cap f^{-1}(B) \end{eqnarray}$$
         since \(f\) is continuous and \(A\) and \(B\) are open, we must have that \( f^{-1}(A) \) and \( f^{-1}(B) \) are open as well. Then we must have that \( f^{-1}(A) \) and \( f^{-1}(B) \) form a separation of \(X\), a contradiction.
        $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Almost ALL elements of this proof we have gone over, except a very subtle bit of elementary set theory that I snuck in there: the preimage of a union is the union of preimages, the preimage of an intersection is the intersection of preimages, and the image of a union is the union of an image (however, it is not true that the image of an intersection is the intersection of images). At this point, we surprisingly have enough information to prove the Intermediate Value Theorem for real valued functions (you could technically generalize the IVT a little more so that it maps into a totally ordered set endowed with the order topology, but the proof is literally the same).
    </p>
    <h6><b>Intermediate Value Theorem:</b></h6>
    Let \(X\) be a connected topological space, let \(f: X \to \mathbb{R} \) be continuous. Choose \(a , b \in X\) such that \( f(a) < f(b) \) and pick some real number \(d\) with \( f(a) < d < f(b) \). Then there exists some point \(c \in X\) such that \(f(c) = d\).
    <div class="showbar">
      <button type="button" id="showIVTProof" onclick="showbutton('IVTproof', 'showIVTProof', 'Proof')" class="btn btn-dark">Show Proof</button>
      <div id="IVTproof" style="display: none; text-align: left; padding-left:15px; padding-right:15px;">
        <p><h6><b>Proof:</b></h6> Let \(A = f(X) \cap (-\infty, d)\) and \(B = f(X) \cap (d, \infty)\). Clearly \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint and (with respect to the subspace topology on \( f(X) \)) are both open. Now suppose, to the contrary, there does not exist such \(c \in X\) such that \(f(c) = d\). Then \(f(X)\) would equal \(A \cup B\) so that \(A\) and \(B\) form a separation of \( f(X) \). However, this would contradict the fact that continuous maps of connected spaces are connected; therefore, such \(c \in X\) must exist.
        </p>
        $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6><b>Lemma:</b></h6>
    The union of connected sets with a point in common is connected.
    <div class="showbar">
      <button type="button" id="showConnectedUnionProof" onclick="showbutton('connectedunionproof', 'showConnectedUnionProof', 'Proof')" class="btn btn-dark">Show Proof</button>
      <div id="connectedunionproof" style="display: none; text-align: left; padding-left:15px; padding-right:15px;">
        <p><h6><b>Proof:</b></h6> Let \(\{ X_\alpha \}\) be a collection of connected sets and let \( x \in X_\alpha \) for all \(\alpha\). Let \( Y = \bigcup_{\alpha} X_\alpha \), and supposed to the contrary that \(Y\) is disconnected. Then there exist disjoint nonempty open sets \(A\) and \(B\) such that \( Y = A \cup B \), and thus \(x\) must lie in one of the two sets, say \(A\). However, every \(X_\alpha\) contains \(x\), so it must be the case that every \(X_\alpha\) intersects \(A\) implying \(B\) is empty -- a contradiction.
        </p>
        $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> We now introduce a fundamental concept in the study of topology: a <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="A continuous function that introduces similarities in structure between two topological spaces">homeomorphism</a>. The definition of a homeomorphism is fairly straightforward: it is a continuous bijection with continuous inverse. To break it down, recall how a continuous function has the property that the inverse sends open sets to open sets; well, since the inverse is continuous also that means that the function sends open sets to open sets both ways. Moreover, since the function is a bijection, we know that we have a nice pairing between open sets. It is now time for us to introduce our last theorem on connectedness:
    </p>
    <h6><b>Theorem:</b></h6>
    The product of connected sets is connected.
    <div class="showbar">
      <button type="button" id="showConnectedProductProof" onclick="showbutton('connectedproductproof', 'showConnectedProductProof', 'Proof')" class="btn btn-dark">Show Proof</button>
      <div id="connectedproductproof" style="display: none; text-align: left; padding-left:15px; padding-right:15px;">
        <h6><b>Proof:</b></h6> <p>Let \( X\) and \(Y\) be connected spaces. Fix \(y \in Y\). Note that the space \(X \times \{ y \}\) is homeomorphic to \(X\), and thus connected as well. Similarly, for every \(x \in X\), the set \( \{x\} \times Y \) is connected. Then by the previous lemma, for every \(x \in X\), the set \( U_x = (\{ x \} \times Y) \cup (X \times \{ y\}) \) is connected since it has the common point \( (x, y) \). Then \( \bigcap_{x \in X} U_x = X \times \{ y \} \), and thus \( \bigcup_{x \in X}U_x = X \times Y \) is connected.
        </p>
        $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>And there you have it, basically all you've ever wanted to know about what makes a space connected and where that gets you. Later on (not in this post) I'll introduce the concept of path connectedness for the sake of the fundamental group and homology; though this is not a difficult idea per se, the realm of homology certainly requires a solid background in elementary topology.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h4 id="item-4">Compactness</h4>
    <p>
    This is a somewhat hard concept to introduce, but it would be almost impossible for me to go forward in the study of topology without it. Consider a singleton element \(\{ a \}\) in \(\mathbb{R}\). Recall that a set is closed if its compliment is open, well the compliment of \(\{ a \}\) is simply the set \( (-\infty, a) \cup (a, \infty)  \). Since the union of open sets is open by our topological axioms, we see that a singleton is closed. Now, under the laws of basic set theory (specifically <a class="popLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws">De Morgan's Law</a>), the complement of a union is the intersection of complements and the complement of an intersection is the union of complements. Hence, the axioms for closed sets change a little for a topological space \(X\):
    <ol>
    <li> The empty set \(\emptyset\) and the ambient space \( X \) are both closed</li>
    <li> The union of finitely many closed sets is closed </li>
    <li> The arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed </li>
    </ol>
    Again, if you were to look at most textbooks, (\(2\)) would say something more like the union of two closed sets is closed -- the result simply follows by induction. So what makes the closed sets \( [0, 1] \) and \( \{ 2^{-100}, 2^{-99}, \dots, 2^{0} \} \) so much different? The answer is compactness (If you answered connected you would also be correct). Back when mathematicians studied <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="A topological space with the added structure of distance (where distance is generalized to 4 axioms). The basis of open sets become open balls of radius r &gt; 0">metric spaces</a> (which had further generalized things like Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces), they had thought that the unique property of the set \( [a, b] \) in \(\mathbb{R}\) was something that we now call <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="Every infinite subset of X has a limit point also contained in X">Limit Point Compactness</a>. When we later introduce the conept of Hausdorff spaces, this continued to confuse mathematicians as to whether the nice properties came from Limit Point Compactness, <a style="color: #00c624;" data-toggle="tooltip" title data-original-title="The property that every infinite sequence has a convergent subsequence">Sequential Compactnesss</a>, or regular compactness. Eventually, mathematicians would stumble upon the most generalized form of compactness in a topological space that binds the two other types to countable compactness in a Hausdorff space and binds all three together in a metric space.
