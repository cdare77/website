# My Personal Website
### Chris Dare

I. Purpose
-----------

This website is intended as a personal blog for topics of personal interest (i.e. higher level mathematics, theoretical physics, coding, and classical literature); however, this blog may possibly contain elements of personal bias (though I plan to avoid that as much as possible), which would likely arise in the more subjective topic of classics. In addition to being a mere blog, I will likely also have sections dedicated to my personal tastes and photographs. Hence, this website is a hybrid of a personal blog and personal website. 

II. Source Code
----------------

The entirety of this project is coded by hand; no third party sites were used to generate the webpage aside from an Apple Music Marketing WebApp which allows users to access my Apple Music Playlists. This was the only non-Apple Developer option for referencing such playlists in a HCI-friendly format. 

Overall, the project utilizes HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4.0, and jQuery 1.7. The latter two are referenced through CDNs on each webpage, though only a few of the webpages have scripts running for jQuery (as Bootstrap requires a jQuery unit). 

III. Future Plans
------------------

In order to allow other users to review on my blogs, I would like to allow some capability for a user to comment on my blog posts. I will likely do this through a dual anonymous / facebook API interface; that is, a user will have the option to post anonymously or through FaceBook login (so that I don't have to create a SQL server of users and such).
